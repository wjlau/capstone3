# Capstone 3 Proposal 

## Fantasy Basketball 
* While I'm not an avid basketball fan that follows all things basketball, I did grow up with an older brother whom I collected basketball cards and watched games with. Every year when fantasy basketball rolls around, all I hear my brother and fiance talk about is their lineup for the week as they trash talk each other. 
* Problem I'm trying to solve: As I've mentioned before, I'm not an avid basketball fan, but I'm also not totally indifferent - and as someone who suffers from FOMO, I've tried playing along one year and had joined their fantasy basketball league. Little did I know, I was using up an important spot for a rookie who had barely even played before simply because his hair looked cool and whatever "stats" he had looked good enough to me. And of course for those basketball players that I did know, they were clearly the stars of their team and were in high demand - so who am I to pick? For this project, I would like to use clustering to find similar players in order to produce fantasy basketball player tiers. Another area I'd love to explore is the idea of "positionless basketball" - instead of players playing certain positions (i.e. point guard, shooting guard, etc.), all players can play at any place on the court. This has been a major shift for a lot of teams as we now see traditional roles and positions on the court going by the wayside in favor of more dynamic players who can slot into multiple different spots on the court. However, is basketball really becoming "positionless" or will we be able to determine new archetypes?

## Recipes
* I love cooking and I love traveling - a perfect blend of both is the different cuisines the world has to offer (this is probably the best we can do given the pandemic). I would like to do something related to nlp and recipes - perhaps categorizing cuisines with NLP
* Not sure what data to use but I have looked for websites with tags. i.e. [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/grilled-carrots-with-cumin-serrano-yogurt)
